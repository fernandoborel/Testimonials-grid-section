I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most gruelling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."</h2>

I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. They entire curriculum and staff did not dissapoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've offen referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommended! "</h2>
